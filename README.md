# Smart-Switch-Board
A smart switch board to monitor and display the power consumption from a particular plug point, just like a smart power meter in our home, with the switch controllable by the MCU.
The use cases are to Monitor and display power consumption, power factor, and capability of storing and transmitting data (this plug extension can be used to monitor power consumption of a particular device like Fridge/TV/AC/heater or even EV chargers)
‚óè The plug can be enabled with timer, it can be programmed for turning on and off at fixed intervals, can be controlled by a switch (basically a prototype of IOT enabling for home devices)
